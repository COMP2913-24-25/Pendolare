# Sprint 2 Retro

## What went well
* Journey service complete 👍👍👍
* All journey endpoints completed 👍👍
* Booking service done bar payment integration 👍👍
* Admin Service returning results!!! Getting weekly revenue, available/cancelled journeys, users who need discount 👍
* Client app in a place where someone else can pick it up 👍
* DB table, endpoints, requests and responses finalised for payment 👍

## What could we improve
* Integrations not in the state we aimed for 👍👍👍👍
* Lots of tickets not updated, no branches linked 👍👍👍👍
* Too much losing sight of tickets, not focusing on right things 👍👍👍👍
* azure is annoying 

## Actions for next sprint
* Full client - api integration 👍👍👍👍👍
* Unit tests and wiki / specification across services for consistancy 👍👍👍👍👍
* **Josh to add test running back into workflows** 👍👍👍
* Tests for the journey service need more work 👍
* Update tickets and link branches 👍
* More tests for admin service on different types of data

## Configuring Booking Fees and Discounts

### Configure the booking fee

This feature allows managers to specify an app-wide booking fee. To set the fee:

- Enter the desired percentage.
- Click the Update button to save your changes.
- Once changed, this new booking fee will apply to all new bookings that are made.

### Configure discounts

This feature enables managers to create and manage discount offers for users.  
To create a new discount:

- Select the 'Create New Discount' button and input the discount details.
- Once established, discounts can be seen in this area, so managers are able to modify or delete them as required.

**Note:** You may not be able to delete an existing discount. This means that it is in use by a current journey, and the journey must be completed or cancelled before the discount can be removed.

## Messaging

The messaging area allows managers to communicate with users who require support. When a user initiates a support request, it will appear in this section. Managers can click on a conversation to review the message and respond directly from the dashboard, allowing for efficient communication between users and managers.
